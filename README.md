# 3370_P

The folder labeled Audio in the Assets folder, was just a test/practice to see if I could add sound effects to the bombs and batteries. However, I was not able to figure it out, but I decided to leave it in the code to see my thought process. As well, as the script labled "SoundEffect", those can be disregarded as they don't affect the game when it runs.
 
Also, the particles prefab and within the code of 'batteries_producer' don't do anything as I couldn't figure it out either. It is just there for my thought process.
